 rtti.js
=====================

`rtti.js` is not a framework; this is a set of conventions which implements
runtime type checking in the practical, dirty, malformed, cumbersome JavaScript
world. Since `rtti.js` is not a framework, you can use `rtti.js` even without
the npm package `rtti.js`. `rtti.js` is merely an utility function set to
implement `rtti.js`.

That's all. Thank you very much.
